# Terraform Kubernetes Installer for Oracle Classic IaaS

![readme md_logo_v0 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36317955/52099850-028fbd80-2629-11e9-9814-9ce9ac491120.png)

## About

The Kubernetes Installer for [Oracle Classic IaaS][oci-c] provides a Terraform-based Kubernetes installation for the
[Oracle Cloud@Customer (OCC)][occ] & [OCI-Classic (OCI-C)][oci-c] Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platforms.

This installer utilises the [Terraform Oracle Public Cloud Provider][opc provider].
It consists of a set of [Terraform][terraform] configurations & shell scripts that are used to provision the Kubernetes control plane
in accordance with [Oracle Container Services for use with Kubernetes (OCS-K)][ocs-k].
This automation suports installation of x2 branches of OCS-K:

 - Production Release: based on Kubernetes version 1.9.1, as released upstream.
 - Developer Release: based on Kubernetes version 1.11.3, as released upstream.

The OCSK Kubernetes distribution has passed the [CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance program](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/). _For enterprises and startups using Kubernetes, conformance guarantees interoperability from one Kubernetes installation to the next. It allows them flexibility and vendor independence._

## Cluster Overview

Terraform is used to _provision_ the cloud infrastructure and any required local resources for the Kubernetes cluster including:

#### OCI Infrastructure:

 - Creates single-node compute instance:
   - x1 OCPU utilised.
   - Installed OS distribution is Oracle Linux 7.2.
   - Includes associated storage and networking elements.
   - Reserves and associates a public IP address to the instance.

 - Installs Kubernetes cluster (master node):
   - Taints the node to support worker function.

#### Cluster Configuration:

Terraform uses `remote-exec` scripts to handle the instance-level _configuration_ for the instance to provision:

- Single node Kubernetes master configuration.
- Installation is in accordance with the previously referenced [OCS-K][ocs-k].
- Kubernetes cluster version: 1.9.1. or 1.11.3.
- Kubernetes Dashboard and kube-DNS cluster add-ons.
- Optional - Monitoring and Metrics:
  - Grafana, Heapster, & InfluxDB for enhanced monitoring and metrics.
- Optional - Microservices Environment:
  - Include WeaveScope Microservices Dashboard and E-Commerce application. Functioning microservices e-commerce application (Socks Shop) with additional enhanced management dashboard.
- Optional - Kubernetes Ingress:
  - Include [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) Ingress and sample applications. Functioning K8s ingress & controller (L7 Load Balancer) deployed and configured to perform path based traffic steering to x3 sample microservices applications.
- Optional - Service Mesh:
  - Include [Istio](https://istio.io) Service Mesh. Functioning Istio service mesh and integrated sample microservices application (BookInfo – per _istio.io_).

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install [Terraform][terraform] (v0.11.3 or later). Follow the link for Hashicorp [instructions](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).
2. [Terraform OPC provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/opc/index.html#) (can be pulled automatically using terraform init
directive once Terraform is configured).
3. Register an account at the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=113:101) (OCR). Be sure to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions after registering with the OCR. The installer will request your OCR credentials at build time. _Registration with the OCR is a dependency for the installer to be able to download the containers which will be used to assemble the K8s control plane._

## Quick start
### Deploy the cluster:

Initialize Terraform:

```
$ terraform init
```

View what Terraform plans do before actually doing it:

```
$ terraform plan
```

Use Terraform to Provision resources and stand-up k8s cluster on OCI:

```
$ terraform apply
```

At this point the configuration will prompt for the following inputs before building the cluster:

````bash
$ variable "ociUser"
$ #(input compute user account with compute_operations rights)

$ variable "ociPass"
$ #(input password for “ociUser”)

$ variable "idDomain"
$ #(input compute tenancy service instance id)

$ variable "apiEndpoint"
$ #(input compute tenancy rest endpoint url)

$ variable "containerRepoUser"
$ #(input oracle container registry username)

$ variable "containerRepoPass"
$ #(input oracle container registry password)
````

Installer will also ask the user if the Developer branch should be installed (Kubernetes v1.11.3), and if any of the following `environments` should be provisioned to the cluster. Enter `true` or `false` for each item accordingly:

````bash
$ OCS-K Developer Branch:
$ #Install Kubernetes from the Developer preview branch (More recent version, however Oracle suggests not be used in production.)

$ Enhanced Dashboard, Monitoring and Metrics:
$ #include grafana, heapster, & influxdb..

$ microservices environment:
$ #include weavescope microservices dashboard and e-commerce application..

$ kubernetes ingress:
$ #include traefik ingress and sample applications..

$ Service Mesh:
$ #include istio service mesh, and integrated sample microservices application..
````

The entire build and cluster creation process is automated – no further input is required.

### Access the cluster:

The Kubernetes cluster will be running after the configuration is applied successfully, and the remote-exec scripts have completed. Typically, this takes around 15-25 minutes after `terraform apply` and will vary depending on the overall configuration, geographic location, and number of `environments` selected.

Once completed, Terraform will output the public IP address of the cluster:

````bash
$ Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
$
$ Outputs:
$
$ Master_Node_Public_IPs = [
$     129.199.199.199
$]
````

Terraform will also output the Kubernetes running services and pods via tabular format at the conclusion of the installation process.

To access Kubernetes dashboard, or any of the other web interfaces running in the cluster:
SSH tunnel to the IP address of the Kubernetes dashboard pod &/or other pods via the public/NAT IP address assigned to the compute instance. Keys are located in the directory `./ssh`.

To access the Traefik dashboard, browse to the public IP address of the instance on port 8080.

_**Keys are provided for simplicity only, for long running deployments it is strongly recommended that you replace the provided keys prior to deployment.**_

### Scale, upgrade, or delete the cluster:

During the setup process, kubeadm-setup.sh generates and outputs to stdout a token that can be used to add more nodes to the cluster. Further instruction is available via [OCS-K](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E88884/html/kubernetes_install_worker.html).

## Notes
 - [Oracle Container Services for use with Kubernetes (OCS-K)][ocs-k]:
Oracle provides a setup and configuration script that takes advantage of the kubeadm-setup.sh cluster configuration utility. This script eases the setup on Oracle Linux including configuration of networking, firewall, proxies and the initial cluster deployment, as well as providing additional support for backup and recovery.
